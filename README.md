# CodeCloset-P2
Welcome to our awesome project, Code Closet.  This is a speciality shopping site for web
developers who want clothes that are comfortable to code in, and fashionable to zoom in.
This is a full stack project that allows users to create a login, go to the members site
to shop for clothes, review and edit their cart, and finally find a fun surprise waiting in
the closet link.
